# About

This is a blog for exploring my interests, which include intelligence, genomics, eugenics, group differences, medicine,
economics, ethics, transhumanism, and so on. I want to be able to explore and learn and fumble towards a better understanding of
these somewhat controversial topics without facing negative professional repercussions, hence the anonymity.
Writing can produce clarity, or at least reveal points of confusion better than thoughts left unspoken,
so I think that having a public blog to write such thoughts down is a net positive.

If you see any factual errors on my blog or want to leave a comment, feel free to reach out to me at softsweep at protonmail dot com or on twitter @softsweep.
