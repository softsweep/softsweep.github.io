# About

This is a blog for exploring topics that would likely lead to negative professional consequences 
for me were it known that I were thinking about them.
There are many of such topics given the current academic climate, and I expect their number to grow over the next decade or so, 
potentially in unforseeable ways. 
But writing can produce clarity, or at least reveal points of confusion better than thoughts left unspoken, 
so I think that having a public blog to write such thoughts down is a net positive.
Controversial topics are often also important topics, and so it is important to try to think clearly about them. 
This process often involves making mistakes and being wrong, something that is currently heavily punished, 
depending on what wrong conclusions one comes to, regardless of the thought process that leads one there.

Specifically, I am interested in the topics of intelligence, genomics, eugenics, group differences, medicine,
economics, ethics, transhumanism, and so on. I want to be able to explore and learn and fumble towards a better understanding of
these topics without losing my livelihood, hence the anonymity. If you see any factual errors on my blog, feel free to reach out to me
